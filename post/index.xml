      <description>I recently had the privilege of participating the Increasing Rust&amp;rsquo;s Reach(IRR) program. The program aims to grow Rust&amp;rsquo;s community of project collaborators and leaders. Increasing Rust&amp;rsquo;s Reach brings together Rust team members and individuals who are underrepresented in Rust&amp;rsquo;s community and the tech industry for a partnership of three (3) months, from mid-May to mid-August. Each partnership agrees to a commitment of 3–5 hours per week working on a Rust Project.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I released the rust_gpiozero1 crate. It is a port of the GPIO Zero2 library by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The library provides a simple interface to control GPIO devices with a Raspberry Pi. Following this, recently ported the Raspberry Pi Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Physical Computing with Python3 guide for Rust.
Why did I create the rust_gpiozero crate? After going through The Rust Programming language book, I decided to work on a side project to practice some of the concepts.</description>

      <description>While working with Rust, you will often come across r#&amp;quot;something like this&amp;quot;#, especially when working with JSON and TOML files. It defines a raw string literal. When would you use a raw string literal and what makes a valid raw string literal?
When would you use a raw string literal? First, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what a string literal is. According to the The Rust Reference1, A string literal is a sequence of any Unicode characters enclosed within two U+0022 (double-quote) characters, with the exception of U+0022 itself2.</description>

      <description>The National Computer Board(NCB) of Mauritius recently announced the Open Data Mauritius portal1. It contains 100 datasets on topics such as Agriculture, Crime, Justice and Security, Health and Tourism. The portal is powered by the DKAN Open Data Platform2, which is a community-driven, free and open source open data platform that gives organizations and individuals ultimate freedom to publish and consume structured information.
DKAN includes a number of APIs3 to allow it to communicate with external applications.</description>

      <description>This is an I2C implementation for mma7660fc-based 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer. It is an embedded-hal driver as part of the weekly driver initiative by Jorge Aparicio.
The Device The MMA7660FC is a ±1.5 g 3-Axis Accelerometer with Digital Output (I2C). It can be found on Seeed&amp;rsquo;s Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer. It is made by NXP Semiconductor.
 Development For the development of this driver, I used the Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer and tested on a Raspberry Pi 1 running latest version of Raspbian.</description>

      <description>What is Arduino? Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform. An Arduino board is development hardware consisting of a programmable microcontroller. The boards can collect information(inputs), act on the inputs(processing) and finally produce outputs. Typically, Arduino boards are programmed using the Arduino programming language through the Arduino IDE using custom firmware(sketches). Arduino exists in many forms and flavours, from the official boards such as the UNO, ArduinoBoard 101 and MEGA, to Arduino-compatible ones like the NodeMCU.</description>

      <description>When it comes to starting a DIY Electronics project, one can be overwhelmed by the myriad of choices. With so many varieties out there, how to get started?
The basic components include: Processing, Input/Output, Circuits and Wiring and Power.
 Processing: the brain of the project, typically development boards which enable us to run our program logic.
 Inputs/Outputs: sensors, actuators, and other gadgets we connect to our boards to enhance our projects.</description>

      <description>The Developers Conference, organised by the MSCC, is the BIGGEST tech event in Mauritius. DevCon brought together tech enthusiasts, hobbyists, numerous user groups, prestigious companies, students, and more!!! I was privileged to present as a Microsoft Student Partner.
My team(@dishaykissoon and me), presented on NodeBots: Using Javascript for hardware programming. The idea was to use NodeBots and Javascript as an entry point to get more people interested in hardware programming and DIY projects.</description>
