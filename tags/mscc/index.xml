      <description>The Developers Conference, organised by the MSCC, is the BIGGEST tech event in Mauritius. DevCon brought together tech enthusiasts, hobbyists, numerous user groups, prestigious companies, students, and more!!! I was privileged to present as a Microsoft Student Partner.
My team(@dishaykissoon and me), presented on NodeBots: Using Javascript for hardware programming. The idea was to use NodeBots and Javascript as an entry point to get more people interested in hardware programming and DIY projects.</description>
