      <description>When working with Rust + Webassembly, you might want to use some crates in your project. Not all crates work out of the box with Webassembly yet, especially those that rely on System Libraries, File I/O, Networking, etc. With proposals such as WASI or WebAssembly Interface Types, these might work eventually but it isn&amp;rsquo;t the case yet.
The Rust Wasm book suggests:
 A good rule of thumb is that if a crate supports embedded and #!</description>

      <description>This is an I2C implementation for mma7660fc-based 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer. It is an embedded-hal driver as part of the weekly driver initiative by Jorge Aparicio.
The Device The MMA7660FC is a Â±1.5 g 3-Axis Accelerometer with Digital Output (I2C). It can be found on Seeed&amp;rsquo;s Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer. It is made by NXP Semiconductor.
 Development For the development of this driver, I used the Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer and tested on a Raspberry Pi 1 running latest version of Raspbian.</description>
